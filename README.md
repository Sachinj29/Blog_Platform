A robust, secure, and feature-rich RESTful API for a blog platform. This project serves as the complete backend for a content management system, handling users, roles, posts, comments, categories, and tags. It is built with a modern Java stack and follows best practices for API development, including JWT-based security and a clean, layered architecture.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure registration and login endpoints using Spring Security and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiated permissions for `USER` and `ADMIN` roles.
*   **Full CRUD for Posts:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts.
*   **Dynamic Content Management:** Full CRUD operations for Categories, Tags, and Comments.
*   **Secure Endpoints:** Protected routes that ensure only authenticated and authorized users can perform sensitive actions (e.g., only an author or admin can delete a post).
*   **Relational Data Model:** Well-structured PostgreSQL database schema to manage relationships between users, posts, comments, etc.
*   **DTO Pattern:** Utilizes Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to expose a clean and secure API, separating it from the internal database structure.
*   **Centralized Exception Handling:** Graceful error handling for a consistent API response experience.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Java 17+** | The core programming language. |
| **Spring Boot** | Framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. |
| **Spring MVC** | Used for building the RESTful API endpoints. |
| **Spring Data JPA** | Simplifies data access layer with repository pattern and Hibernate. |
| **Spring Security** | Handles all authentication and authorization logic. |
| **PostgreSQL** | Powerful, open-source relational database. |
| **JWT (Java Web Token)** | Used for securing API endpoints via tokens. |
| **Lombok** | Reduces boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors). |
| **Maven** | Dependency management and project build tool. |

## üìÅ Project Structure
